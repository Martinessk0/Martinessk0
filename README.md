<h2> Hi there!</h2>
<h3>
  I'm Martin Grahovski, a twenty-year-old from Sofia, Bulgaria, with a huge passion for programming.
  I love diving into languages like C#, SQL, HTML & CSS, and I'm currently honing my skills in JavaScript. 
  As a student at the Technical University in Sofia, I get to explore the exciting world of technology every single day.
  I thrive on challenges and approach them with determination, fueled by my love for coding. 
  My ultimate goal? To leave my mark in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
